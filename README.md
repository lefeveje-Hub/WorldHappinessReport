# World Happiness Report Analysis (CareerFoundry Project)

## Project Summary
This is a data visualization project for a hypothetical Washington DC-based think tank who wants to analyze the relationship between personal freedoms and national happiness metrics, based on the World Happiness Report dataset from the Gallup World Poll survey. The dataset, produced by The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (United Nations), provides comprehensive measurements of global well-being through nationally representative samples of approximately 3,000 respondents per country.
The analysis incorporates key metrics including:

- Happiness scores
- GDP per capita
- Social support metrics
- Life expectancy
- Freedom indices
- Corruption levels
- Generosity measurements

## Data context
This project creates interactive visualizations demonstrating how various factors, particularly the freedom to make life choices, contribute to national happiness levels. Using survey data collected between 2014 - 2019 we analyze how six key factors (economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity) influence life evaluations across different countries.
The survey data employs the Cantril ladder methodology, where respondents rate their lives on a scale of 0 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible). These factors are compared against a hypothetical "Dystopia" - a reference point representing the world's lowest national averages.

## Code Overview
Code was written in Python and executed in Jupyter notebooks.

Utilizes the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
OS: For interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations.
Matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter: For custom formatting of axis ticks in plots.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and creating informative, attractive graphics.
Scipy: For scientific and technical computing, including advanced mathematical functions.

## Project Presentation was created in Tableau Public
